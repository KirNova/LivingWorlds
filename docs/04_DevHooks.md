# ğŸ§© Living Worlds â€“ Developer Entry Points (Dev Hooks)

This document provides an overview for developers who want to implement or expand the Living Worlds concept into real-world games, mods, or simulations.

The goal is to provide **low-barrier entry**, **clear technical anchors**, and **maximum creative freedom**.

## ğŸ§± Core Components for Dev Integration

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| âœ… NPC State Engine | Manages NPC traits, mood, memory, goals, relationships |
| âœ… Tick System | Advances time and updates world/NPC state |
| âœ… Event Engine | Triggers world-level changes, reactions, and consequences |
| âœ… Data Layer | JSON, SQLite or DB for storing persistent state |
| âœ… AI Bridge (Optional) | Local LLM (like Mistral, LLaMa) for deep dialogue or worldbuilding |

---

## ğŸš€ Recommended Integration Paths

### 1. Godot Engine (3 or 4)
- Tick-based simulation via `SceneTreeTimers`
- Nodes for each NPC with internal logic/memory
- JSON/Dict for world state
- Ideal for prototyping and open-source workflows

### 2. Unity (C#)
- Use `ScriptableObjects` or MonoBehaviours for NPC logic
- Implement a tick-based coroutine system
- Use SQLite or flat files for persistent NPC state
- Recommended for more advanced, production-ready games

### 3. Text-Based / Browser Simulation
- Python/Node-based CLI or Flask/Express interface
- JSON or lightweight SQLite for world state
- Perfect for testing world logic and NPC interactions

## ğŸ›  Tools and Libraries

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `sqlite3` / `tinydb` | Local persistent NPC state |
| `llama.cpp` | Local LLM inference (no internet needed) |
| `pyttsx3` / TTS | Optional: Voice-based feedback |
| `godot-python`, `godot-csharp` | Extendable scripting options |
| `promptflow`, `langchain` | AI logic / prompt chaining if LLM used |

---

## ğŸ§ª How to Start

1. Clone the repository  
2. Use the included NPC + Tick simulator (`demo/`)  
3. Choose your preferred game engine  
4. Implement:
   - Load NPCs from file or DB
   - Simulate ticks
   - Update memory, mood, relationships
5. Optional: Add world map, zones, or interaction UI

---

## ğŸ§  Optional: AI Integration Concept

If you want to give your NPCs real conversation:

- Use `gguf` models with `llama.cpp` or `text-generation-webui`
- Load the model locally (e.g. `mistral-7B.Q4`)
- Create prompts like:

```txt
You are Tharam, a tired hunter. You are resting but still haunted by your past. Mira just arrived at your cabin.
```

Then combine with:
- Mood â†’ Response bias
- Memory â†’ Inject relevant facts
- Goal â†’ Evaluate outcome of the conversation

## âœ¨ Final Words

Living Worlds is **engine-agnostic** and **open by design**.  
Use only what you need. Rewrite what doesnâ€™t fit. Extend what inspires.

> Build the world youâ€™ve always wanted to play in â€”  
> one that doesnâ€™t need you to exist,  
> but remembers you when you return.
