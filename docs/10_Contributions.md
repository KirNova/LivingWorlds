## 📜 Code Style

- Use **clear variable names** (e.g. `npc.memory`, `tick_handler`, `save_world`)
- Document functions with purpose and input/output
- Prefer **modular functions** with low side-effects
- Python is welcome (3.9+ preferred), but any language is fine

---

## 🧪 Suggested Standards

- Format: `.json` or `.sqlite` for world data
- Each NPC: Has `id`, `traits`, `mood`, `relationships`, `memory`
- Sim loop: Tick-based
- All saves: Human-readable where possible

## ✨ Final Note

You don’t need to be a dev to contribute.  
Writers, artists, thinkers — this world needs your voice too.

> A living world is not made by code alone.  
> It grows with every soul that touches it.
