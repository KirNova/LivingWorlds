# Living Worlds – Core Concept Overview

## What is this?

Living Worlds is a prototype for RPGs where NPCs:

- Live and age independently
- Have their own memory, goals and emotions
- React to time, events and relationships
- Can break rules of lore based on personality or change

## Why?

Because static games stop being meaningful.  
This project explores a way to simulate **living NPCs** and **a breathing world** without real-time AI training.

## How?

By combining:

- Structured NPC data
- A simulation tick system
- Event triggers and emotional logic
- (Optional) AI-enhanced behavior or LLMs

## Goal

To inspire developers to move from scripted design to emergent storytelling —  
where no two players share the same world.
