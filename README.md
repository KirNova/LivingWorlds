# 🌍 Living Worlds – A New Generation of RPGs Through Dynamic AI Simulation

> *"Games should not wait for you. They should live."*  
> — Concept by **Kir Nova**, open and free for all.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

**Living Worlds** is a fully open-source vision for a new kind of RPG —  
a world where **NPCs live their own lives**, make decisions, love, fail, remember, and die —  
**with or without you**.

Not driven by scripts.  
Driven by memory, emotion, time, and consequence.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Most games today:
- Freeze when the player leaves
- Offer static NPCs with no real growth
- Follow prewritten paths

**Living Worlds changes this:**

✅ NPCs are born, grow, form relationships, and fade — like people  
✅ The world continues evolving while you're away  
✅ Events unfold from a web of decisions — not from code triggers  
✅ Rules can be broken. Lore can be questioned. Personal stories emerge.

## 🔧 How It Works (Technically)

This concept does **not require training your own AI model**.  
Instead, it simulates intelligence by combining:

- 🧬 Structured data models for NPCs (goals, traits, memories, moods)
- 🕒 A ticking simulation that keeps the world alive
- 💭 Behavior logic based on state, emotion, and decision trees
- 💾 Persistent memory using JSON or database storage
- 🧠 Optional integration with LLMs (like Mistral or LLaMa) for deeper conversation or storytelling

The result?  
A world that *feels* alive — because it remembers, changes, and surprises you.

## 📣 Call to Devs

This is not a finished product.  
This is a **movement**. A **seed**. A **spark**.

If you're a developer, writer, dreamer —  
**take this. Build upon it. Show us what happens when games stop following scripts and start following consequences.**

Together, we bring life into code.
